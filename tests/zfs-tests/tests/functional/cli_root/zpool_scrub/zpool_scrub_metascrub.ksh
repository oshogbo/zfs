#
# DESCRIPTION:
#	Verify that `zpool scrub -m` (metadata scrub) only detects metadata
#	errors and skips data block errors.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Create a large file in the pool.
#	2. Inject data (L0) errors and run a metadata scrub.
#	3. Verify no errors are found (data blocks are skipped).
#	4. Inject indirect block (L1 and L2) errors, run a metadata
#	   scrub, and verify errors are detected.
#	5. Create a directory with many entries, inject errors into its
#	   L0 blocks (ZAP content, which is metadata), run a metadata
#	   scrub, and verify errors are detected.
#	6. Verify that last_scrubbed_txg is not updated by metascrub.
#	7. Verify that 'zpool status' retains a completed full scrub's
#	   summary line after a subsequent metascrub, and vice versa.
